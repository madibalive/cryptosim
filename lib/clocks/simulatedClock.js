/**
 * Class representing a controllable clock used for simulation and testing.
 * The clock allows for playing forward at different speeds in time, pausing
 * and resuming, skipping forward to a preset date, etc.
 *
 * The simulated clock represents elapsed time in two ways. The first is the
 * a timestamp representing the last point in real time that the clock has
 * been played or resumed. This piece of date, when subtracted from the current
 * time and multiplied by the playing speed gives an indication of the
 * simulated time that has elapsed since the last play event. The second is
 * a variable `elapsedMilliseconds` which stores the total number
 * of simulated time that elapsed. Whenever the clock is paused the elapsed
 * time based on the first method is computed and rolled into the second method.
